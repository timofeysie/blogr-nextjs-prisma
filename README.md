# Fullstack Authentication Example with Next.js and NextAuth.js

This is the starter project for the fullstack tutorial with Next.js and Prisma. You can find the final version of this project in the [`final`](https://github.com/prisma/blogr-nextjs-prisma/tree/final) branch of this repo.

## Workflow

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Prisma commands

```txt
npx prisma studio
```

You need to update Prisma every time the schema file change by running the following command:

```txt

```

To create the tables in your database, you now can use the following command of the Prisma CLI:

```txt
npx prisma db push
```
